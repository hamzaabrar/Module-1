            <td>
              The Samsung Galaxy S20 is the best smartphone available right now.
              That covers both the S20 and the larger Galaxy S20 Plus, as
              there's very little difference between the two handsets aside from
              size and a couple of specs. They take the very best of what's on
              the smartphone market and put it together in a compelling package
              that we loved testing.

              The OnePlus 8 Pro blew us away when we reviewed it, and the
              company is tussling with Samsung and Apple on our best phones list
              for that very reason. While the OnePlus 8 is also an option, it's
              missing many of the features we like about the Pro, which we
              outline below.

              Want something a bit more from your iPhone? You're in luck with
              the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, as they feature improved spec
              including a more high-end rear camera that can compete with the
              very best. It'll cost more than the iPhone 11 (which is probably
              the best phone for the average iPhone user), but if you're after
              the very best iPhone, the Pro range is what you want.

              This is the highest we've ever had Oppo rank on our best phone
              list, and that's because the Oppo Find X2 Pro is the most
              accomplished phone from the manufacturer so far. You'll find a top
              display, processor, camera and much more on the Oppo Find X2 Pro
              that justifies its high price tag. The battery life isn't
              fantastic, but otherwise this is one of the very best phones on
              sale right now.
